To install a sonarqube on ec2 machine. Today we will be installing a Sonarqube on Ubuntu machine which has Instance type-
t2.medium and has cpu-2 and memory 4GB.

Once the instance is launched, SSH into it and run the following commands to install Docker:
1. Install Docker

Once you see the below screen, Hit the public ip of the ec2 machine followed by :9000. Make sure you whitelist the port no 9000 in
the security group of the EC2 Machine.

Once you hit the ip followed by :9000. Below screen should be visible
